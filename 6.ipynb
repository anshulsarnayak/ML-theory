    "1. In the sense of machine learning, what is a model? What is the best way to train a model?\n",
    ": A training model is a dataset that is used to train an ML algorithm. It consists of the sample output data and the corresponding sets of input data that have an influence on the output.\n",
    "for training model,\n",
    "Define adequately our problem (objective, desired outputsâ€¦).\n",
    "Gather data.\n",
    "Choose a measure of success.\n",
    "Set an evaluation protocol and the different protocols available.\n",
    "Prepare the data (dealing with missing values, with categorial values).\n",
    "Spilit correctly the data.\n",
    "then train the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the sense of machine learning, explain the \"No Free Lunch\" theorem.\n",
    ":The No Free Lunch Theorem is often thrown around in the field of optimization and machine learning, often with little understanding of what it means or implies. The theorem states that all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.\n",
    ":Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models. k-fold cross validation is a procedure used to estimate the skill of the model on new data. There are common tactics that you can use to select the value of k for your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Describe the bootstrap sampling method. What is the aim of it?\n",
    ":Bootstrap Sampling is a method that involves drawing of sample data repeatedly with replacement from a data source to estimate a population parameter. This technique allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using random sampling methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the significance of calculating the Kappa value for a classification model? Demonstrate how to measure the Kappa value of a classification model using a sample collection of results.\n",
    ": Kappa basically tells you how much better your classifier is performing over the performance of a classifier that simply guesses at random according to the frequency of each class.To calculate the Kappa coefficient we will take the probability of agreement minus the probability of disagreement divided by 1 minus the probability of disagreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Describe the model ensemble method. In machine learning, what part does it play?\n",
    ":Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model .It produces Optimal predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a descriptive model's main purpose? Give examples of real-world problems that descriptive models were used to solve.\n",
    ":A descriptive model describes a system or other entity and its relationship to its environment. It is generally used to help specify and/or understand what the system is, what it does, and how it does it.e.g,circuit design model that describes electrical components and their interconnections.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Describe how to evaluate a linear regression model.\n",
    ":There are 3 main metrics for model evaluation in regression:\n",
    "R Square/Adjusted R Square.\n",
    "Mean Square Error(MSE)/Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error(MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Distinguish :\n",
    "1. Descriptive vs. predictive models\n",
    ":A descriptive model will exploit the past data that are stored in databases and provide you with the accurate report. In a Predictive model, it identifies patterns found in past and transactional data to find risks and future outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Underfitting vs. overfitting the model\n",
    ":This situation where any given model is performing too well on the training data but the performance drops significantly over the test set is called an overfitting model. On the other hand, if the model is performing poorly over the test and the train set, then we call that an underfitting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bootstrapping vs. cross-validation\n",
    ":Cross validation splits the available dataset to create multiple datasets, and Bootstrapping method uses the original dataset to create multiple datasets after resampling with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Make quick notes on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LOOCV.\n",
    "LOOCV(Leave One Out Cross-Validation) is a type of cross-validation approach in which each observation is considered as the validation set and the rest (N-1) observations are considered as the training set. In LOOCV, fitting of the model is done and predicting using one observation validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. F-measurement\n",
    "The F-measure can be viewed as a compromise between recall and precision. It is high only when both recall and precision are high.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The width of the silhouette\n",
    "the silhouette width is also an estimate of the average distance between clusters. Its value is comprised between 1 and -1 with a value of 1 indicating a very good cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Receiver operating characteristic curve\n",
    "Receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. "
