    "1.What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    ":Machine learning is a learning of a data in which our model will find out a pattern from which it will learn and build a model from which we will predict new outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    ":Machine learning is great for problems whose solution requires a great deal of work or a long list of rules, complex problems that are hard to get a solution of using a traditional method, fluctuating environments and getting insights about complex problems and large data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    ": In supervised learning , The training set which we feed to the Algorithm which includes desired solutions is known as labeled training set . \n",
    "\n",
    "4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n",
    ": Regression and Classification .\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n",
    ": Common unsupervised tasks include clustering, visualization, dimensionality\n",
    "reduction, and association rule learning .\n",
    "\n",
    "6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?\n",
    ":Reinforcement learning .\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n",
    ": For unsupervised learning we can use Clustering and for suprvised there are many classification algorithm one of them is logistic regression .\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    ":It is supervised learning problem .\n",
    "\n",
    "9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    ":An online learning system can learn incrementally, as opposed to a batch learn‚Äêing system. This makes it capable of adapting rapidly to both changing data andautonomous systems, and of training on very large quantities of data .\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    ":Out-of-core algorithms can handle vast quantities of data that cannot fit in a computer's main memory. An out-of-core learning algorithm chops the data into mini-batches and uses online learning techniques to learn from these minibatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    ": Instance based learning .\n",
    "\n",
    "12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\n",
    ": The model parameter is parameter of model while hyperparameter is parameter of learning algorithm .\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    ":Model-based learning algorithms search for an optimal value for the model parameters such that the model will generalize well to new instances. We usually train such systems by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the system is at making predictions on the training data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized. To make predictions, we feed the new instance's features into the model's prediction function, using the parameter values found by the learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n",
    ": lack of data, poor dataquality, nonrepresentative data, uninformative features, excessively simple models that underfit the training data and excessively complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    ":Then the model is overfitted . Possible solutions to overfitting are getting more data, simplifying the model , reducing the noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    ":A test set is used to estimate the generalization error that a model will make on new instances, before the model is launched in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    ":A validation set is used to compare models. It makes it possible to select the best model and tune the hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    ":The train-dev set is used when there is a risk of mismatch between the training data and the data used in the validation and test datasets .\n",
    "\n",
    "19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    ": If you tune hyperparameters using the test set, you risk overfitting the test set and the generalization error you measure will be optimistic ."
