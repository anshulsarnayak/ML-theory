    "1. Provide an example of the concepts of Prior, Posterior, and Likelihood.\n",
    ": Prior probability shows the likelihood of an outcome in a given dataset. For example, in the mortgage case, P(Y) is the default rate on a home mortgage, which is 2%. P(Y|X) is called the conditional probability, which provides the probability of an outcome given the evidence, that is, when the value of X is known.\n",

    "2. What role does Bayes' theorem play in the concept learning principle?\n",
    ":ayes Theorem is a method to determine conditional probabilities â€“ that is, the probability of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Offer an example of how the Nave Bayes classifier is used in real life.\n",
    ":To mark an email as spam, or not spam.Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can the Nave Bayes classifier be used on continuous numeric data? If so, how can you go about doing it?\n",
    ":Naive Bayes is a classifier and will therefore perform better with categorical data. Although numeric data will also suffice, it assumes all numeric data are normally distributed which is unlikely in real world data.\n",
    "and for Continuity We can discretize each continuous attribute and then replace the continuous attribute value with its corresponding discrete interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are Bayesian Belief Networks, and how do they work?? What are their applications? Are they capable of resolving a wide range of issues?\n",
    ":Bayesian network models capture both conditionally dependent and conditionally independent relationships between random variables. Models can be prepared by experts or learned from data, then used for inference to estimate the probabilities for causal or subsequent events.Bayesian Networks allow easy representation of uncertainties that are involved in medicine like diagnosis, treatment selection and prediction of prognosis.\n",

Let I be the random variable that indicates whether someone is an intruder I = 1) or not I = 0), and A be the variable that indicates alarm I = 0). If an intruder is detected with probability P(A = 1|I = 1) = 0.98 and a non-intruder is detected with probability P(A = 1|I = 0) = 0.001, an alarm will be triggered, implying the error factor. The likelihood of an intruder in the passenger population is P(I = 1) = 0.00001. What are the chances that an alarm would be triggered when an individual is actually an intruder?\n",

An antibiotic resistance test (random variable T) has 1% false positives (i.e., 1% of those who are not immune to an antibiotic display a positive result in the test) and 5% false negatives (i.e., 1% of those who are not resistant to an antibiotic show a positive result in the test) (i.e. 5 percent of those actually resistant to an antibiotic test negative). Assume that 2% of those who were screened were antibiotic-resistant. Calculate the likelihood that a person who tests positive is actually immune (random variable D).\n",

There may be a customer coming into the bank with a 5% chance in each 5-minute time period, or there may be no customer (again, for simplicity, we assume that either there is 1 customer or none, not the case of multiple customers). If there is a client, the CCTV will detect them with a 99 percent probability. If there is no customer, the camera can take a false photograph with a 10% chance of detecting movement from other objects.\n",
