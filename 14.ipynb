    "1. What is the concept of supervised learning? What is the significance of the name?\n",
    ": supervised learning is a learning where input and output is provided to predict swith having labeled features.\n",
    "Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well labeled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the hospital sector, offer an example of supervised learning.\n",
    ":Diagnosis and disease identification,prediction of diabetes ,Finding the best cure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Give three supervised learning examples.\n",
    ":Linear regression for regression problems.\n",
    "Random forest for classification and regression problems.\n",
    "Support vector machines for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In supervised learning, what are classification and regression?\n",
    ":In supervised learning Classification is the task of predicting a discrete class label. Regression is the task of predicting a continuous quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Give some popular classification algorithms as examples.\n",
    ":Popular algorithms that can be used for binary classification include: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees,Naive bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Briefly describe the SVM model.\n",
    ":A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they're able to categorize new text.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. In SVM, what is the cost of misclassification?\n",
    ":In cost-sensitive learning instead of each instance being either correctly or incorrectly classified, each class (or instance) is given a misclassification cost. Thus, instead of trying to optimize the accuracy, the problem is then to minimize the total misclassification cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In the SVM model, define Support Vectors.\n",
    ":Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. In the SVM model, define the kernel.\n",
    ":“Kernel” is used due to set of mathematical functions used in Support Vector Machine provides the window to manipulate the data. So, Kernel Function generally transforms the training set of data so that a non-linear decision surface is able to transformed to a linear equation in a higher number of dimension spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are the factors that influence SVM's effectiveness?\n",
    ":Support vector machine is a classifier, based on the structured risk minimization principle. The performance of the SVM depends on different parameters such as penalty factor, , and the kernel factor. Also choosing an appropriate kernel function can improve the recognition score and lower the amount of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the benefits of using the SVM model?\n",
    ":SVM works relatively well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes. SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces. SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. SVM is relatively memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.  What are the drawbacks of using the SVM model?\n",
    ":SVM algorithm is not suitable for large data sets.\n",
    "SVM does not perform very well when the data set has more noise i.e. target classes are overlapping.\n",
    "In cases where the number of features for each data point exceeds the number of training data samples, the SVM will underperform.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Notes should be written on\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The kNN algorithm has a validation flaw.\n",
    ":Some Disadvantages of KNN\n",
    "Accuracy depends on the quality of the data.\n",
    "With large data, the prediction stage might be slow.\n",
    "Sensitive to the scale of the data and irrelevant features.\n",
    "Require high memory – need to store all of the training data.\n",
    "Given that it stores all of the training, it can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the kNN algorithm, the k value is chosen.\n",
    ":The optimal K value usually found is the square root of N, where N is the total number of samples. Use an error plot or accuracy plot to find the most favorable K value. KNN performs well with multi-label classes, but we must be aware of the outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A decision tree with inductive bias\n",
    ":Inductive Bias in Decision Tree Learning is that Shorter trees are preferred over longer trees. Trees that place high information gain attributes close to the root are preferred over those that do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What are some of the benefits of the kNN algorithm?\n",
    ":Quick calculation time,\n",
    "Simple algorithm – to interpret ,\n",
    "Versatile – useful for regression and classification,\n",
    "High accuracy – you do not need to compare with better-supervised learning models,\n",
    "No assumptions about data – no need to make additional assumptions, tune several parameters, or build a model. This makes it crucial in nonlinear data case.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What are some of the kNN algorithm's drawbacks?\n",
    ":Accuracy depends on the quality of the data,\n",
    "With large data, the prediction stage might be slow,\n",
    "Sensitive to the scale of the data and irrelevant features,\n",
    "Require high memory – need to store all of the training data,\n",
    "Given that it stores all of the training, it can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Explain the decision tree algorithm in a few words.\n",
    ": decision tree is a very specific type of probability tree that enables you to make a decision about some kind of process.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between a node and a leaf in a decision tree?\n",
    ":Each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch denotes the outcome of a test, and each leaf node holds a class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is a  decision tree's entropy?\n",
    ":entropy helps us to build an appropriate decision tree for selecting the best splitter. Entropy can be defined as a measure of the purity of the sub split. Entropy always lies between 0 to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "19. In a decision tree, define knowledge gain.\n",
    ":nformation gain helps to determine the order of attributes in the nodes of a decision tree. The main node is referred to as the parent node, whereas sub-nodes are known as child nodes. We can use information gain to determine how good the splitting of nodes in a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Choose three advantages of the decision tree approach and write them down.\n",
    ":Easy to read and interpret  without requiring statistical knowledge ,\n",
    "Easy to prepare ,\n",
    "Less data cleaning required.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Choose three dis-advantages of the decision tree approach and write them down.\n",
    ":A small change in the data can cause a large change in the structure of the decision tree causing instability.\n",
    "For a Decision tree sometimes calculation can go far more complex compared to other algorithms.\n",
    "Decision tree often involves higher time to train the model.\n",
    "Decision tree training is relatively expensive as the complexity and time has taken are more.\n",
    "The Decision Tree algorithm is inadequate for applying regression and predicting continuous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Briefly describe the random forest model.\n",
    ":The random forest is a classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees. It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree."
