    ":clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.\n",

    "DBSCAN clustering algorithm. \n",

    "2. What are some of the most popular clustering algorithm applications?\n",
    ":Clustering technique is used in various applications such as market research and customer segmentation, biological data and medical imaging, search result clustering, recommendation engine, pattern recognition, social network analysis, image processing.\n",

    "3. When using K-Means, describe two strategies for selecting the appropriate number of clusters.\n",

    "7. How do you tell the difference between anomaly and novelty detection?\n",
    ":In outlier detection, you dataset may already have outliers and your goal is to identify such outliers. Both novelty detection and outlier detection are used to detect anomalies. Outlier detection is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm. Novelty detection is a semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithm.\n",

    ": Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) assume that there are a certain number of Gaussian distributions, and each of these distributions represent a cluster. Hence, a Gaussian Mixture Model tends to group the data points belonging to a single distribution together.\n",
