    "1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
    ":Human Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes and preferences. Learning from Pattern of behaviours .e.g, Playing guitar , acting on a stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
    ":\n",
    "Different forms of Human learning are ,\n",
    "Learning through association - Classical Conditioning.\n",
    "Learning through consequences – Operant Conditioning.\n",
    "Learning through observation – Modeling/Observational Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes there are some machine learning equivalents,\n",
    "Observational learning  is like Searching for a Pattern which is ML .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?\n",
    ": Machine learning is a learning where machine learns through some given patterns or feeding data.it works with supervised learning if both Input and Output is given or it goes with Unsupervised learning where it finds pattern itself .\n",
    "The key responsibilities are,\n",
    "1.Designing ML systems.\n",
    "2.Researching and implementing ML algorithms and tools.\n",
    "3.Selecting appropriate data sets.\n",
    "4.Picking appropriate data representation methods.\n",
    "5.Identifying differences in data distribution that affects model performance.\n",
    "6.Verifying data quality.\n",
    "7.Training and retraining systems when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define the terms \"penalty\" and \"reward\" in the context of reinforcement learning.\n",
    ":A reinforcement learning algorithm, which may also be referred to as an agent, learns by interacting with its environment. The agent receives rewards by performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the term \"learning as a search\"?\n",
    ":learning can be viewed as the task of searching through a large space of hypotheses implicitly defined by the hypothesis representation. The goal of this search is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the various goals of machine learning? What is the relationship between these and human learning?\n",
    ": the goal of ML is to understand the data and make accurate predictions . automation, optimization, and augmentation are the Main goals of ML .Human learning would get so easy because of ML .\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Illustrate the various elements of machine learning using a real-life illustration.\n",
    ":\n",
    "Chatbot.\n",
    "Virtual Personal Assistants. \n",
    "Predictions while Commuting. \n",
    "Videos Surveillance. \n",
    "Social Media Services. \n",
    "Email Spam and Malware Filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Provide an example of the abstraction method.\n",
    ":Abstraction “displays” only the relevant attributes of objects and “hides” the unnecessary details. For example,driving a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning process?\n",
    ":Generalization refers to your model's ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the one used to create the model.It Determines whether a model is good or not in machine learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?\n",
    ": Classification in ML is used to classify the things based on data while regression predicts the exact Value and they are continious Values.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was solved using regression.\n",
    ":Regression models are used to predict a continuous value .With the help regressor models we can predict the value .the example is Predicting House Price .\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe the clustering mechanism in detail.\n",
    ": Clustering algorithm is used to divide the data with certain features.Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Make brief observations on two of the following topics:\n",
    "i. Machine learning algorithms are used\n",
    ":\n",
    "machine learning uses programmed algorithms that receive and analyse input data to predict output values within an acceptable range. As new data is fed to these algorithms, they learn and optimise their operations to improve performance, developing 'intelligence' over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Studying under supervision\n",
    ":\n",
    "Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well \"labelled\" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Studying without supervision\n",
    ":\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is not provided with any pre-assigned labels or scores for the training data. As a result, unsupervised learning algorithms must first self-discover any naturally occurring patterns in that training data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement.\n",
    ":\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward."
