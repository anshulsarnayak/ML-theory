    "1. Explain the term machine learning, and how does it work? Explain two machine learning applications in the business world. What are some of the ethical concerns that machine learning applications could raise?\n",
    ": Machine learning is learning where machine learns from feeded data,with the help of ml algorithms it predicts and automates,\n",
    "example,\n",
    "1.Customer Lifetime Value Prediction :Machine Learning and data mining can help companies to predict customer behavior and purchase patterns. The algorithms assist in sending the best possible offers to individual customers, based on their browsing and purchase histories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Detecting Spam :Spam filters in e-mail applications can now create new rules by using neural networks to identify spam and phishing messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML presents three major areas of ethical concern for society: privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, and perhaps the deepest, most difficult philosophical question of the era, the role of human judgment .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe the process of human learning:\n",
    "i. Under the supervision of experts\n",
    ":here the process will be best as experts are having supervision.\n",
    "ii. With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner\n",
    ":here the process will be good as we have assistance. \n",
    "iii. Self-education\n",
    ":here the process of leraning will be better as we get self exploratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provide a few examples of various types of machine learning.\n",
    ":Various type of machine learning are as follows,\n",
    "1.Supervised ML : in these the both input and output data is given .e.g, linear regression,logistic regression.\n",
    "2.Unsupervised ML : in these there is only input data with no labels.e.g, k-means Clustering , DBscan Clustering.\n",
    "3.Reinforcement Ml :is a ML training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones.e.g, How a Robotic dog learns the movement of his arms .\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examine the various forms of machine learning.\n",
    ":These are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning .\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Can you explain what a well-posed learning problem is? Explain the main characteristics that must be present to identify a learning problem properly.\n",
    ": A (machine learning) problem is well-posed if a solution to it exists, if that solution is unique, and if that solution depends on the data / experience but it is not sensitive to (reasonably small) changes in the data / experience.\n",
    "In general, to have a well-defined learning problem, we must identity these three features: the class of tasks, the measure of performance to be improved, and the source of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Does machine learning is capable of solving all problems?explain?\n",
    ": Yes machine learning is capable of solving all problems .As ml interprets data it get's the problem solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the various methods and technologies for solving machine learning problems? Any two of them should be defined in detail.\n",
    ":Regression :Regression methods are used for training supervised ML. \n",
    "Classification : Classification algorithms can explain or predict a class value. \n",
    "Clustering : Clustering algorithms are unsupervised learning methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Can you explain the various forms of supervised learning? Explain each one with an example application.\n",
    ": there are various forms of Supervised learning,\n",
    "1.Linear regression :here we predict data linearly with y=mx+c e.g, House prediction.\n",
    "2.logistic regression: here we classify the data lineraly .e.g, Classifying species.\n",
    "3.Decision Tree :here we create branches of yes/no with questions and make decisions .e.g, Bank loan decision.\n",
    "4.K-Nearest Neighbour : The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol 'K'.e.g, dog or cat close call finding.\n",
    "5.Support vector machine :The linear SVM classifier works by drawing a straight line between two classes. e.g, Facial expression Classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? With a sample application in each region, explain the differences.\n",
    ":\n",
    "In Supervised learning is a machine learning method in which models are trained using labeled data.\n",
    "In Unsupervised learning does not need any supervision(no label). Instead, it finds patterns from the data by its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Describe the machine learning process in depth.\n",
    ": Machine Learning (ML) is a highly iterative process and ML models are learned from past experiences and also to analyze the historical data. On top, ML models are able to identify the patterns in order to make predictions about the future of the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Make brief notes on any two of the following:\n",
    "i. Deep learning applications in healthcare\n",
    ":Deep learning applications in healthcare have already been seen in medical imaging solutions, chatbots that can identify patterns in patient symptoms, deep learning algorithms that can identify specific types of cancer, and imaging solutions that use deep learning to identify rare diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Linear regression (simple)\n",
    ": linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Make a comparison between:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generalization and abstraction\n",
    ":While abstraction reduces complexity by hiding irrelevant detail, generalization reduces complexity by replacing multiple entities which perform similar functions with a single construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Learning that is guided and unsupervised\n",
    ": supervised learning algorithms already know the output, while unsupervised algorithms don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regression and classification\n",
    ": In regression we predict Values,while in Classification we classify ."
